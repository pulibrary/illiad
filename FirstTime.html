                <p>WARNING CONCERNING COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS</p>
                <p>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of articles or
                    other reproductions of copyrighted materials.
                </p>
                <p>Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish an article
                    or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the article or reproduction is not
                    to be &quot;used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research&quot;. If a user
                    makes a request for, or later uses, an article or reproduction for purposes in excess of &quot;fair
                    use&quot;, that user may be liable for copyright infringement.
                </p>
                <p>This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment
                    of the order would involve violation of copyright law.

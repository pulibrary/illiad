			<h3>What is ILLiad?</h3>

			<p>ILLiad is the electronic system you use to request an item through Interlibrary Loan.
The name ILLiad can be thought of as an acronym for <u>I</u>nter<u>L</u>ibrary <u>L</u>oan <u>i</u>nternet <u>a</u>ccessible <u>d</u>atabase.</p>

			<h3>How is ILLiad better than traditional ILL systems?</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>You will find it easier to submit your interlibrary loan requests. With ILLiad, you enter your name, address, and other personal information into the system only once, at the time of your first request.</li>
				<li>Your request will be handled more rapidly and accurately as problems relating to misinterpretation of hand-written requests are eliminated.</li>
				<li>You can get many of your photocopies more quickly through Electronic Delivery.</li>
				<li>You can get information about the status of your request through the Web at any time from any location without having to call the ILL Department.</li>
				<li>Library personnel are able to serve you better because all data about your request and its handling is stored in a searchable database. We are able to respond quickly to your
    				inquiries about your request. We are also able to gather statistical information about the
    				performance of the libraries that lend to us, enabling us to make better decisions when
    				choosing a lender to supply an item.</li>

		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Are there any disadvantages to the electronic system?</h3>

			<p>Some people might find it troublesome to have to log into ILLiad using a username and
			password. We believe this is less trouble than traditional paper and electronic systems
			which require you to enter your personal information with each new request.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<a name="userid"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Why do I need a username and password to use ILLiad?</h3>

			<p>Your username and password allows us to give you secure access to information about
			your interlibrary loan requests. We can also enable you to edit your personal information
			such as your address or phone number. </p>

			<p>Your username can be anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an
			alphanumeric code. Your password also can be anything you like. We recommend that you
			follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use
			to access other systems. However, no one but you will know your password, not even the
			library staff. The password you set is stored in an encrypted file.</p>

	</div>
	
	<a name="password"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>What if I forget my password?</h3>

			<p>In the event that you forget your password, please contact the Interlibrary Loan Office
			at (800) 555-1212. We can then reset your password allowing you access to ILLiad. Please
			change your password once you logon to ILLiad.</p>

	<a name="webbrowser"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>What Web browser should I use?</h3>

			<p>You need a Web browser that can handle forms, tables, and preferrably Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). We recommend the current versions of either Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<a name="security"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Is security a problem if I use a public workstation?</a></h3>

			<p>Yes. Web browsers cache information and create a history file on the local workstation.
			This allows a subsequent user of the workstation to access the system under your name
			using the browser's Back button to recall a page from the cache, or by finding a page with
			your personal information in the browser's history file. If you are concerned about the
			security of your interlibrary loan requests, you can take the following steps:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Access ILLiad only from your personal computer or an otherwise secure workstation.</li>
    			<li>Access ILLiad from a public workstation in the Interlibrary Loan office in the library. These computers are supervised by the library staff.</li>
    			<li>When using a public access workstation:
					<ol>
    					<li>Delete from the history file those pages that contain your personal information.</li>
    					<li>Exit from the Web browser before you leave the workstation. This prevents the Back button from accessing the pages you were using.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>

	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Why don't I see all my older requests when I look at my request history?</h3>

			<p>From time to time we purge older records from ILLiad. Our policy is to keep
			requests online for several years order to comply with record keeping requirements
			of the copyright law.</p>

			<h3>Why does my browser say that you're sending a cookie? What's in it?</h3>
